This is my WDD330 Final Project. It is a meal planning and recipe search application. 
I built it with Vite, JavaScript, TheMNealDB API, and Spoonacular API - I will be adding this next. 
It includes recipe search, dynamic rendering, partials (header/footer), and a modern responsive layout.

Features: 
Search recipes by keyword
Display dynamic recipe cards
Meal planning UI (in progress)
Uses ES Modules and Modern JS
Built with Vite for local host review
Custom favicon, styles, and responsive layout. 
API integration (TheMealDB + Spoonacular)
Modular folder structure.

Tech Stack

How to run this project locally, bash npm install and npm run dev and it opens my local host 5173
